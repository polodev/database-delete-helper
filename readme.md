## Database table delete helper 

It will delete all table recursively from a database without deleting database itself.
I am using this to delete all wordpress table and install wordpress again. I have wrote this for this tiny purpose. Code also tiny. 

Hope you will find it useful.


## How to use it 

Just keep this whole folder inside your server. Like `htdocs` in `xampp`, `www` in `wamp`, or `public_html` in your `cpanel`. Then just visit the webpage and enter your database credentials.


Thanks
